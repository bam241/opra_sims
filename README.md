# OPRA Simulations

This respository contains the workflow for the UW-Madison contribution to the
OPRA project. 

## input

This directory contains the scripts that create a suite of input files for the
simulations of interest for the OPRA project. 

Details incoming

## output

This contains an optional bash script to run the input files from the command
line. 

Navigate to this directory and run:
```
$ I don't exist yet
```

The simulation databases should all be housed here because the analysis
directory relies on this file structure.

## analysis

This contains jupyter notebooks that process the simulation output for the EG
scenarios and parameter variations. Each set of figures is in its own
subdirectory.
